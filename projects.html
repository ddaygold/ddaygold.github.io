			<h3 class="proj_header">ITR Lab Door Monitoring</h3>
			<p class="content">
			Lab door monitoring was the first project I did at IIT. Before I came to IIT, some members of the robotics team had installed a sensor on the front door to display if the lab was open or closed on the website. They had used a limit switch off a FRC kit to sense the position of the door, but that design was plagued with problems. Limit switches are great if you have solid mounting points on a robot, but they were just hot gluing the switch to the door, so it was always either misaligned or falling off. 
			</p>
			<p class="content">
			My replacement was extremely simple: a pad of tinfoil on the door jam, and a wire on the door itself. It has lasted for all four years without incident, and remains up working at the ITR <a href="http://illinoistechrobotics.org/lab_status">lab status</a> page.
			</p>
			<p class="content">
			There is also a downstairs blast door of the lab, but it's a sliding door. That door has a similar pad of tinfoil, but instead of it being on the door and the door jam, closing the door grounds the pad. The grounding of the pad signals to an Arduino, which is connected to the server through an Ethernet shield (I bought the shield before Freshman year when I didn't know better). Code for the downstairs Arudino sketch can be found <a href="https://github.com/illinoistechrobotics/frontdoor/blob/master/downstairs/WebServer.ino">at GitHub</a>.

			<h3 class="proj_header">Third Deck Alarm</h3>
			<p class="content">
			During my Junior year, I joined a fraternity on campus, &Phi;&Kappa;&Sigma;, or the "Skulls." Like many fraternities, we have some traditions and historic rivalries. One of those is the eternal war between the glorious armies of Third Deck, and the lowly peasants of Second Deck. The floors of the fraternity house are internally referred to as "decks," supposedly because of a Navy ex-serviceman influence in the years after WWII. There are two residential floor of the fraternity, the second, and the third. The members of the (superior) Third Deck, feel that their floor is "best deck" and often wish to remove Second Deck intruders from the deck.
			</p>
			<p class="content">
			The Third Deckers are rallied by the Third Deck alarm. When I moved in during my pledge semester, the Third Deck Alarm was an MP3 of a submarine's dive horn. The guy at the end of the hall would switch on his extra set of speakers and blare the siren down the hall. This was moderately effective, but an improvement could be engineered. There were two main problems with the MP3 + speaker based third deck alarm: volume and control. Speakers can only get so loud, and they might not be effective through closed doors. Also, the only person who could sound the alarm was the guy at the end of the hall. What if intrusions happened while he was out? We would be defenseless!

			An improvement was engineered.
			</p>
			<p class="content">
			The new design used a 'Wolo Model 330 Oooga Sound Fun 12 Volt Horn' found on Amazon. It has an output of 114 dB. For reference, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Examples_of_sound_pressure">here's</a> Wikipedia's  table of sound pressure to real life examples. Power for the horn is switched with a MOSFET, which is in turn controlled by an Arduino Pro Mini. The Arduino is connected to a Rasberry Pi via a 434 MHz, 300 Baud serial RX-TX pair.

			The connection is one way, from the Pi to the Arudino, and really only needs to transit one bit of information: turn on the alarm. There is some problem with noise on the receiver, so I am using a super simple yet every robust modulation: transmit 'U' = 0x55 = 0101 0101. 
			</p>
			<p class="content">
			The horn is a pretty simple design, but to complete the hack, I made it untouchable. 114 dB's is excessively loud. It is still super loud from behind a door. On the deck, there is a closet with the ladder to the roof. This closet is always kept locked to prevent people from getting on, then falling off, the roof. Inside that room is the perfect place for the alarm. The only problem is that the closet has no outlets! So, I did the responsible thing, cut an extension cord in half, stripped the conductors and wired into the power that used to run to the telephone switchbox. Oh, and they wouldn't let me throw the breaker, so I wired into live wires.
			</p>
			<p class="content">
			Fortunately, I didn't electrocute myself, so now in the closet is the horn, an Arduino, a lead-acid battery and its charger, plugged into half an extension cord wired into the wall. The battery means that you cannot disable the alarm even if you throw the breaker to the deck. Third Deckers are forever protected!

			<h3 class="proj_header">Subwoofer Cabinet</h3>
			<p class="content">
			The first major purchase I made with money I earned myself was a pair of Polk Audio RTi4 Bookshelf speakers in cherry veneer. Then, freshman year I saw a sale on a matching 10' Polk subwoofer on Amazon, so I bought that too. When I got into the Fraternity house, I bought a second subwoofer, which ignited my love of heavy bass music. Knowing that I love bass, one of the graduating brothers took me aside and showed me two 12" 400W subs he pulled out of his brother's car. Suddenly I had 1kW of subwoofer in my possession!
