			I'm Peter Chinetti, a Computer Engineer from the Illinois Institute of Technology. I'm graduating in Spring 2015, and moving out to NYC for work.

			I'm very fortunate that Engineering is what I do for work, school and fun. I didn't have an existential crisis trying to pick a major, I knew that I wanted to be an Engineer. While in school, I spent all four undergraduate years as a member of the <a href="http://illinoistechrobotics.org">Illinois Tech Robotics</a> Team, or ITR. The ITR lab is housed at the site of what used to be IIT's nuclear research reactor. What this means for the members is that we have thick concrete walls and blast doors, which gives us <i>tremendous</i> freedom. While part of the team, I have worked on one first place robot, traveled to California for RoboGames, and pulled many all-nighters working on dumb, crazy projects. More information about the projects I'm extra excited about can be found on my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page.

			Beyond what I worked on at the robotics lab, I also got a degree from IIT. Somewhere around my Sophomore year, I learned what git was as I had to use it for a systems programming class. From then on, I have been storing my work in a git repo (I understand that git is not optimized for tracking binary file changes, but it is so simple for tracking a mixture of code, LaTex, and PDFs). I set up a post-receive script to checkout HEAD to <a href="http://chinetti.me/classes">chinetti.me/classes</a>, which was super useful for printing across campus and for serving as a reference for people who wanted help with a class I'd taken.
